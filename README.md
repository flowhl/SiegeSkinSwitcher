##  :beginner: About
many competitive tournaments and cups require you to unequip every single skin on every operator. If you play DeSBL or Faceit regularly this means that you have to reequip them every time you want to play non-competitive. 

Just toggle your skins on and off with two clicks!
## :zap: Usage
How to setup and use this:

###  :electric_plug: Installation
- run setup.exe
- congrats you are done


###  :package: Tutorial
# Setup:
- click "select savegames folder"
- find your savegame: 
  - its located in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher\savegames\(your uplay id)\635"
  - depending on your uplay accounts use the one id of your main account (probably the one with the most subfolders)
  - it has to be 635 as it implifies which game it belongs to
- select the "635" folder
- click "save current as normal config" to save your current skins as the normal configuration
- unequip every single skin
- click "save current als ESL config" to save the unequipped skins as a template for ESL or other competitive games

# Usage:
- close Siege
- toggle the skins using the slider : ESL mode means no skins
- hit apply and start the game
##  :wrench: Development
- as I only use it from time to time and see no additional features I wont continue developing. It was just a small side project to simplify changing skins
- you can improve it and participate in the development

### :rocket: Deployment
Deployed using squirrel.windows - one click installation with no wizzard needed!

## :question: FAQ
Where is my savegame folder? 
- usually it is "C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher\savegames\(your uplay id)\635"
